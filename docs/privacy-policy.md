# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2026-01-18

WeatherCare ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the WeatherCare app (the "App") handles information.

## Information We Collect

We collect only the information necessary to provide the App’s features:

- **Location information you provide** (such as city or coordinates) to display weather data.
- **Optional profile details** you enter (such as a nickname and avatar for cared contacts).
- **Usage data** such as crash logs may be collected by Apple or the operating system to improve reliability.

## How We Use Information

We use information to:

- Show current weather and forecasts for selected locations.
- Generate caring messages and tips based on weather conditions.
- Improve stability and performance of the App.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell your personal data.

To provide AI-generated text, the App may send limited context (such as city and weather conditions, and optionally a nickname) to our backend service and third‑party AI providers. This data is used only to generate the response.

## Data Storage

Your saved contacts and settings are stored on your device. If your device enables iCloud/backup, Apple may sync this data as part of system services.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
